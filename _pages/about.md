Hello! I'm a dedicated Data Science Ph.D. student at Sapienza University of Rome, where I'm deeply immersed in computer vision as a member of the [PINlab](https://www.pinlab.org/) group.

My academic journey has been a diverse one. I earned my bachelor's degree in Economics, with a particular emphasis on Macroeconomics and Econometrics. This foundation in economics has provided me with a unique perspective on approaching data-driven problems.
For my master's degree, I transitioned into Data Science, specifically focusing on Computer Vision. Within this field, I became particularly interested in multi-agent trajectory forecasting, a fascinating area that presents many challenges and opportunities.

Throughout my ongoing Ph.D. program, my research has evolved further. I've delved into topics such as multi-body pose forecasting, environmental-aware pose forecasting, and exploring higher-order topologies in data. Currently, my primary research focuses on the captivating domains of egocentric view and embodied AI, where we seek to develop AI systems that perceive and interact with their environments more like humans.

Beyond the academic world, I have a passion for photography that allows me to capture and appreciate the beauty in everyday moments. When I'm not in the lab or behind the camera, you'll often find me hiking in nature, reveling in the tranquility and majesty of the outdoors, or hitting the pavement for a rejuvenating jog.
As a researcher and an individual, I'm driven by curiosity, a thirst for knowledge, and a deep appreciation for the intersection of technology and the human experience. I look forward to continuing my academic journey, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in computer vision, and finding inspiration in both the digital and natural worlds.
